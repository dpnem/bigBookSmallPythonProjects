# bigBookSmallPythonProjects
This is me walking though Al Sweigart's "Big Book of Small Python Projects". You can reach Sweigart on Twitter ([@AlSweigart](https://twitter.com/AlSweigart)) or, with a little invesitagtion on your part, other places.

The book is available [for free to read](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/) under the Creative Commons license or [available for purchasee at the publisher No Starch](https://nostarch.com/big-book-small-python-projects) or the dreaded Amazon.

This is just a way for me to go through the code, typing it out function by function and line by lone, to get into the rhythm and patterns of professional coding – instead of my self-tuaght gobbledygook.
